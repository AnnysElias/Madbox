# Madbox
Madbox unity test

Through my interview with Thomas, I gathered that Madbox strongly values being able to create a simple prototype quickly.
So while working on this, I kept in mind getting to a playable idea quickly.


I started by creating path segments that use bezier curves.
Next, I made tha player move along said path curves when the player clicks the screen.

After this I created some level obstacles that can kill the player.

When the player dies, a little particle plays, then the level restarts.

When the player finishes a level, the next level starts (2 levels that loop)



● How much time did this test take you ?

2hours

● What was the most difficult and what made it difficult ?

It's mostly a very simple prototype to quickly get the gameplay across.
The most difficult part would be the bezier curve pathing.

● What could you do better in your opinion and how ?

Create more level elements to build out more levels.
Improve user experience through sound/player feedback

● What would you do if you had more time to go further into this game ?

To further develop this prototype, I would create a little script that generates meshes based on the bezier curve data.
Currently, I simply manually placed the floor elements to save some time on the prototype.
Then I could randomly generate bezier curves+obstacles on the level paths to generate infinite levels.

I would Work with an artist to get some models for obstacles/characters

I would Implement menu/UI

I would Implement more obstacle types.


● What is your opinion about this test?

I feel like the game is prety simple and I could perfectly recreate it without much problems.
So, Then I assume that the real thing you are testing is how quickly I can create a working gameplay prototype.
That's why I focussed on creating the fundamental gameplay in the shortest amount of time.
